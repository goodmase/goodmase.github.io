I am a full stack software engineer experienced in developing mobile applications and scalable web services. Most of my work has been in the development of low cost 3D scanning, computer vision (OpenCV), and asset tracking/management (MRP) applications for medical device/service companies.

My main programming stack consists of: Objective-C, Swift, Python, Go, and Javascript.  

For fun I enjoy hiking, yoga, cooking, and gaming.
